# Neural Network 
  
Simple Neural Network written in C++11.  
The code still needs some tweaking and cleaning (also commenting).  
Neuron object defines a single Neuron.  
NeuralNetwork object defines the whole set of Neuron.  
"main.cpp" is an example. It trains and uses the network as an OR operation.
